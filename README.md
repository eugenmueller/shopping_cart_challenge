# shopping_cart_challenge

Write code that calculates the sum of given shopping carts based on the following pricing:

- grapes: 5$
- apples: 3$
- peaches: 7$

Two types of discounts may apply:
- if the cart contains more than 1 apple, all apples are 20% cheaper
- for each grape in the cart the next grape is free

```ruby
shopping_carts = [
  {
    grapes: 1,
    apples: 0,
    peaches: 1
  },
  {
    grapes: 1,
    apples: 1,
    peaches: 1
  },
  {
    grapes: 1,
    apples: 2,
    peaches: 1
  },
  {
    grapes: 3,
    apples: 1,
    peaches: 1
  }
]
```
